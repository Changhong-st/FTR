# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Play

To start the app, run `yarn` to install packages, and then run `yarn start` to run the app

1. On startup, the program will prompt the user for the number of seconds (X) between outputting the frequency of each number to the screen.
2. Every X seconds the program will display, in frequency descending order, the list of numbers and their frequency.
3. If the user enters 'halt' the timer should pause.
4. If the user enters 'resume' the timer should resume.
5. If the user enters a number that is one of the first 1000 Fibonacci numbers, the system
   should alert "FIB"
6. If the user enters 'quit', the application should output the numbers and their frequency, a
   farewell message, and finally terminate.
